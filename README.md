This font was edited from [Junicode](https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font.git) (v. 2.217) with Greek characters replaced by GFS Porson. This font pretend to be a close "style" of english classical editions of greek texts. In the case of greek extended glyphs, the combining dot below (U+0323) from Junicode was adapted to GFS Porson designs with somes anchors pts. The gothic glyphs G (U+1D50A), M (U+1D510) and P (U+1D513) was imported and adapted from [AltStandard](https://github.com/Ioannes-Brclds/AltStandard.git).
